  - title: Personal Site
    summary: >
      The source code for this website. Written in ReactJS and TS and powered by NextJS. Used TailwindCSS to handle css.
      With plans to expand this website with a personal workstation webapp for use in my physics work, named MatXi.

  - title: CRhythmic
    summary: >
      Rhythm game controller written in C using microprocessors.
      Convert microcontroller accelerometer inputs into computer actuation in rhythm games like DDR. 
      Tilt the controller in each direction and shake to actuate arrow directions and special key inputs.

  - title: Pseudolidar-PointRCNN Fusion
    summary: >
      A key component for Cornell EV team's autonomy stack, which I lead.
      Convert stereo vision into point clouds using depth estimation and perform object segmentation on the 
      resultant lidar-esque output. Based off work by Wang et al. and the PointNet++ architecture.

  - title: Population Dynamics Simulation
    summary: >
      Multi-species population dynamics simulator with visual scripted in OCaml. 
      Curves plotted in real time and differential equations are solved numerically with Runge-Kutta methods.
      Population models include Lotka-Volterra, Replicator, and interspecific competiton with shelter models.

  - title: Useful Algorithms
    summary: >
      Famous algorithms implemented in Java for demonstrative purpose and potential future application.
      Mostly for educative purposes and curiosity. Includes Deterministic Quickselect (median of medians), Ford Fulkerson,
      Gale Shapley, and Zuker Stiegler (RNA Folding).

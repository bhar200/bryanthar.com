  - title: Personal Site
    summary: >
      The source code for this website. Written in ReactJS and TS and powered by NextJS. Used TailwindCSS to handle css.
      Seeking to expand this website with a personal workstation webapp for use in my physics work, named MatXi. It's currently
      under construction.

  - title: CRhythmic
    summary: >
      Rhythm game controller written in C using microprocessors.
      Convert microcontroller accelerometer inputs into computer actuation in rhythm games. 
      Tilt the controller in each direction and shake to actuate arrow directions and special key inputs
      in a computer rhythm game like Dance Dance Revolution.

  - title: Pseudolidar-PointRCNN Fusion
    summary: >
      A key component for Cornell EV team's autonomy stack, which I lead.
      Convert stereo vision into point clouds using depth estimation and perform object segmentation on the 
      resultant lidar-esque output, hence "pseudolidar". 
      Part of a computer vision pipeline implementing work by Wang et al. and the PointNet++ architecture.
      These papers are linked in the repo.

  - title: Population Dynamics Simulation
    summary: >
      Multi-species population dynamics simulator with visual scripted in OCaml. 
      We implement Inspiration by my biology cs friend Qifan Wang, who worked alongside us in this project. 
      Population curves are plotted in real time and differential equations are solved numerically with Runge-Kutta methods.
      Population models supported include Lotka-Volterra, Replicator, and interspecific competiton with shelter models.

  - title: Useful Algorithms
    summary: >
      Famous algorithms implemented in Java for demonstrative purpose and potential future application.
      Mostly for educative purposes and curiosity. Includes Deterministic Quickselect (median of medians), Ford Fulkerson,
      Gale Shapley, and Zuker Stiegler (RNA Folding).
